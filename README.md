# RateMyPDF
RateMyPDF is a website that helps paper form authors (particularly for court forms) improve the usability of their forms for self-represented litigants. It uses the FormFyxer library to deliver its insights.

The [first version](https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/docassemble-PDFStats) of this website ran on Flask. This repository replaces it with a version on FastAPI.

It has been described in a paper published in the proceedings
of ICAIL '23. You can view it [here](https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/complexity/complexity/#download-and-cite-our-paper).

## Running locally

Install requirements:
